								<h2>Paid Research Positions for Creative Students</h2>

							<p>Curiosity and creativity are fundamental to scientific progress. Astronomers follow their curiosity, ask thoughtful questions, craft new paths to answers, observe what's around us, work hard, and help people understand the Universe in new ways. Artists do all that too! The Colorado Scholars of Astrophysics and Art is a program for undergraduate students to explore the Cosmos through funded research projects at the intersection of astronomy and art.</p>


								<h3>Colorado Scholars of Astrophysics and Art</h3>

								<p>The Colorado Scholars of Astrophysics and Art (CSA<sup>2</sup>) program provides paid research fellowships for undergraduate students, focused on discovery and exploration through astronomy and art at CU Boulder. Scholars will lead independent research projects that combine astrophysical research techniques with artistic creativity.
								Scholars will be advised by <a href=https://casa.colorado.edu/~bertathompson/  target="_blank">Prof. Zach Berta-Thompson</a>, with access to consultation from members of his exoplanet research group, <a href=https://www.colorado.edu/fiske/  target="_blank">Fiske Planetarium</a> staff, and artists connected to the <a href=http://nestcuboulder.org/  target="_blank">Nature, Environment, Science & Technology (NEST) Studio for the Arts</a>. Scholars will have opportunities to make art, ask questions, define goals, collaborate in groups, write code, test assumptions, revise approaches, explore results, and share their work. Funding is available to pay scholars $13/hour for working and learning up to 40 hours/week in the summer and 10 hours/week in the academic year. Additional funds will be available for materials and supplies. </p>

								<p>Through CSA<sup>2</sup>, scholars will have the opportunity to create artwork for display on campus and/or online. We will emphasize the value that is brought to scientific exploration by artistic approaches to observing and knowing. By creating new ways to interact with astronomy, students will also contribute to scientific discovery, to what we exhibit through CU's public Fiske Planetarium and NEST Gallery, to how we teach astrophysics and planetary science at CU Boulder, and to a database of projects for use in astronomy learning across the world. In all this work, we will collectively strive for equity, collaborative learning, valuing diverse perspectives, and celebrating hard work and new ways of thinking.
								</p>

								<p>Scholars will have broad freedom to explore projects of their choosing. Examples might include projects like creating 3D stereographic images from widely-separated cameras, knitting the curvature of space-time around a black hole, illustrating cartoons that teach astronomical concepts, writing poems with text scraped from literature papers, painting data-informed imaginary sunsets on exoplanets, making photograms with  UV-sensitive cyanotype paper, embroidering foundational astronomy plots on fabric, creating long-exposure time-lapse videos of the sky, building paper spectrographs to observe lights and pigments, crafting LED constellations with paper electronics, animating logarithmic maps of the Universe, or countless other ideas you develop!</p>

								<p><i>For summer 2020,</i> we are particularly interested in projects that might usefully connect, at least tangentially, to developing new labs for CU's introductory ASTR1030 course. Those labs are being revised for safety against the coronavirus, and we want your help developing creative new activities for astrophysics learning. Furthermore, given the need for social distancing to stem the spread of the virus, work this summer will mostly be completed remotely.</p>

								<h3>How to Apply</h3>
								<p>
								Applications are currently open for positions starting in summer 2020, with a due date of <b>June 30, 2020</b>. Starting dates and the number of hours you want to work each week are flexible. Applications will be reviewed by a team of scientists/artists/scholars from the Department of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences. To apply, please complete the application below, which asks for the following items:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										a brief <a href=https://www.colorado.edu/career/students/resumes  target="_blank">resume/CV</a> that includes previous work and academic experience
									</li>
									<li>
										a sample of any type of astronomical or artistic work that you have completed and of which you are particularly proud (a problem set, a painting, a piece of code, a photo, a homemade sundial, whatever)
									</li>
									<li>
										short statements about what strengths you feel you could bring to CSA<sup>2</sup>, what skills you would like learn and develop as scholar, and an idea in astrophysics you have found to be really beautiful or compelling
									</li>
									<li>
										your anticipated time availability for CSA<sup>2</sup> over the rest of the summer and the coming academic year
									</li>
									<li>
										some basic demographic information
									</li>
								</ol>

								<p>Interview requests will be sent out soon after the application due date. If you have any questions about these scholarship positions or the application process, please contact <a href="mailto:zach.bertathompson@colorado.edu">Zach Berta-Thompson</a>.
